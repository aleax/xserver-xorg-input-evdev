Description: X.Org X server -- evdev input driver
 This package provides the driver for input devices using evdev, the Linux
 kernel's event delivery mechanism.  This driver allows for multiple keyboards
 and mice to be treated as separate input devices, and matched on physical
 attributes such as which USB port they're connected to.
 .
 Note that this driver is different from Protocol "evdev" in the keyboard and
 mouse drivers, as shipped with Ubuntu 4.10 and 5.04, and Debian 3.1.
 .
