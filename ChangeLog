    Don't enable the device if the grab failed with ENODEV.
    
    After suspend/resume, sometimes the device doesn't come back up on the same
    node. Since we do not call PreInit for the device (which would detect this
    situation), we continue to try to read a nonexisting file, spamming the log
    file with "Read Error".

    Fail if the device cannot be grabbed during the probe.
    
    If the grab fails, this is most likely a sign that the device has been grabbed
    already (probably by a device specified in xorg.conf). So let's not add the
    device to the server's input device list, since it won't generate events
    anyway.
    
    Exception: keyboards and kernel 2.4 are not affected.

    In the mouse driver, these options are only used if XFree86LOADER is

    Don't allow relative and absolute axes on the same device.
    
    This is a bit of a mess. The MS Optical Desktop 2000 registers both relative
    and absolute axes on the same device (the mouse). The absolute axes have a
    valid min/max range for x/y and thus overwrite the x/y relative axes in the
    server (no, this is not a server bug). And I wouldn't be surprised if other
    devices have similar issues.
    
    Since the device only sends relative events after that, the mouse is
    essentially restricted to the min..max range of 0..255. The server simply
    doesn't do unrestricted relative axis and restricted absolute axis on the same
    device (not for the same axis numbers anyway).

    Not many mice do this, but some do, Apple Mighty Mouse in particular, and

    Arguably we should filter _all_ repeat events from the kernel and handle
    synthesizing them in the server.

    There are two major classes here, touchscreens and touchpads.  Touchpads
    are logically more like relative devices, in that your initial touch
    should not warp the cursor.  So attempt to detect touchpads (via the
    existence of BTN_TOUCH) and translate absolute events from those devices
    to relative motion.

    Set repeat_delay and repeat_interval to default values
    
    Set ctrls->repeat_delay and ctrls->repeat_interval so that keys will be automatically repeated in software.

    Filter all incoming repeated key events
    
    Not just filter modifiers but every repeated key, because the software implementation will take care of what key to
    repeat and what not. Otherwise the kernel's autorepeated keys interfere with the software generated ones.

    Don't inform kernel evdev driver about autorepeat change
    
    We do autorepeat in software now. Informing the kernel would change the autorepeat speed on virtual terminals, which is
    probably not wanted so we leave the settings untouched.

    Clear EV_ABS_V_USE_TOUCH for devices without a touch button
    
    VMware's absolute pointing device does not have a pressure/touch button.
    Although evdev correctly recognizes this, it sets "use_touch" for X and Y axes
    regardless of the touch button. This patch clears the USE_TOUCH flag for the X
    and Y axes if the device does not have a touch button.

    evdev.man minor fixes
    
    * Use \- (ASCII dash) instead of - (hyphen), where appropriate
    * Use a roff escape instead of a UTF-8 character.
    * Consistent use of quote characters.
    * Consistent use of typographic conventions:
      italic "n" in place of "<N>" or "integer" or "number",
      bold for option names, bit maps, etc.

        Redid evdevBtnRec with the new mapping goodness.
    
        Removed v_min and v_max from evdevAbsRec.
    
        Reworked evdev_option_token_t, no union, no is_chain.
        If it's a chain, it still has a string, but the chain pointer is set.
    
        EvdevParseMapToButton, EvdevParseMapToButtons, and EvdevParseMapOption.
    
    evdev_axes.c:
    
        Kill off EvdevAxesMapButton, a variant lives in evdev_btn.c now.
    
        Changes for the evdev_option_token_t changes.
    
        Use EvdevParseMapOption instead of repeating the contents twice.

    Alright, this is a really big commit that breaks stuff.
    
    evdev.h:
    
        Switch to flags in the abs and rel structs.
    
        Add the axes struct, and defines.
    
        Rework the abs and rel structs, moving stuff to the axes struct and moving
        everything to the new mapping handling.
    
        Add the structs and function declarations for the new tokenization stuff,
        parsing stuff, and mapping stuff.
    
    evdev.c: Add EvdevTokenize, and the evdev_map_parsers list.
    
    evdev_axes.c:
    
        Basicly a full rewrite, big, messy.
    
        We now use a completely different mapping setup for axes, and mapping to
        buttons is currently missing.
    
        However we now handle ABS_CALIB and ABS_AREA, including rotation in both
        rel and abs modes.
    
    evdev_btn.c:
    
        Disable lots of code and break things horribly, we compile but we don't
        work very well.
    
        Fixing this is next on my todo list.

Author: Zephaniah E. Hull <warp@agamemnon.b5>
Date:   Thu Jul 13 11:59:25 2006 -0400

    Split the New functions so that structs can be allocated and buttons
    detected, and then stuff that depends on _other_ areas.
    (Specificly, axes and btn have a circular dependency on which one has to
    run first, this solves that.)
    
    Add button names, and a way to get a button number from a name.
    
    Add a function for checking to see if a button exists, takes the number from the previous function.
    
    Change the (unused) state array of pointers in the button struct to an array of pointers to functions for callback.
    
    Implemented the 'touch' feature, on by default if BTN_DIGI_TOUCH exists,
    won't, in rel mode, process x/y data unless it's down, and is used to
    try and make 'pick up stencil, move to other side of digitizer, set back
    down' not jump to the other side of the screen in rel mode.
    (This doesn't work as well as it could, but I'm fairly sure that it's
    due to the quality of the absolute input device I'm using, but feedback
    would be really nice.)
    
    FIXME: Update the manpage for this.

    evdevAbsRec: Remove the scale bool, rename scale_x and scale_y to scale[2].
        evdevAxesRec: Make btnMap an int array instead of a Card8 array.
    Make abs support and non-core stuff actually work.
    Relative emulation for abs mode is still a bit broken, but that's far less
        critical.
    How many buttons we've registered is configuration information, not an
        error message.

    Removed.
    New, a mix of rel and abs that should actually work in the rel case.
    Rearrange include order. btnMap was moved from being part of rel to being
        part of axes.

    Reduce EVDEV_MAXBUTTONS to 96.
    Split up evdevStateRec into a struct with pointers to new structs for btn,
        abs, rel, and key.
    New structure type for handling the device capability bitmaps.
    Add device bits and struct input_id to evdevDeviceRec.
    Add matching device bits, struct input_id, and pass number to

    Remove the errno.h include, it's in evdev.h for now.
    Move the bit getting from the drivers to here, into evdevDeviceRec.
    Fix a rare case of fd leakage.
    Add several new (and somewhat ugly) device matching options: <map>Bits:
        Where map is one of ev, key, rel, abs, msc, led, snd, or ff. In the
        format of '+0 +3 -1-2 ~5-10', requires bits 0 and 3 be set, bits 1 and
        2 to not be set, and at least one bit in the range of 5 to
    10 be set. bustype, vendor, product, and version: Simple integer options
        for matching the struct device_id fields, must be 0 (the default) or
        the exact value you wish to match against. pass: Bounded to 0-3,
        devices are matched to the first matching entry found, order for
        multiple matching entries in the same pass is undefined, but it starts
        with pass 0 and goes to pass 3.
    Adaptation for the evdevStateRec split and the change in capability bitmap
        handling.
    Add evdevGetBits to fill the new evdevBitsRec struct type.
    Lots of somewhat ugly code for matching by capability bits.
    Split out of evdevRescanDevices to smaller handling functions. The new
        design should be better if I decide to handle arbitrary Device fields
        again.
    Adaptation for the evdevStateRec split and the change in capability bitmap
        handling.
    Handle all buttons, no button compression at this time, however we reorder
        things so that BTN_MOUSE comes before BTN_MISC, somewhat evily.
    Support for the new btn->state[] array of int pointers.
    Adaptation for the evdevStateRec split and the change in capability bitmap
        handling.
