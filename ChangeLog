commit 12a27693b9bb41b9222c5c2256815d225ee75929
Author: Peter Samuelson <peter@p12n.org>
Date:   Thu Oct 11 00:09:40 2007 +0200

    evdev.man minor fixes
    
    * Use \- (ASCII dash) instead of - (hyphen), where appropriate
    * Use a roff escape instead of a UTF-8 character.
    * Consistent use of quote characters.
    * Consistent use of typographic conventions:
      italic "n" in place of "<N>" or "integer" or "number",
      bold for option names, bit maps, etc.

    Wheel mice work again!
    (Old configs don't.)
    
    evdev.c:
    
        Add EvdevParseMapToButton and EvdevParseMapToButtons to evdev_map_parsers.
    
        Add EvdevParseMapOption to search through evdev_map_parsers.
    
        Fix up EvdevTokenize to handle the evdev_option_token_t changes.
    
        EvdevAxesNew0 after BtnNew0 instead of before now.
        (This isn't the right fix.)
    
    evdev.h:
    
        EVDEV_MAXBUTTONS -> BTN_MAX.
    
        Redid evdevBtnRec with the new mapping goodness.
    
        Removed v_min and v_max from evdevAbsRec.
    
        Reworked evdev_option_token_t, no union, no is_chain.
        If it's a chain, it still has a string, but the chain pointer is set.
    
        EvdevParseMapToButton, EvdevParseMapToButtons, and EvdevParseMapOption.
    
    evdev_axes.c:
    
        Kill off EvdevAxesMapButton, a variant lives in evdev_btn.c now.
    
        Changes for the evdev_option_token_t changes.
    
        Use EvdevParseMapOption instead of repeating the contents twice.
    
        Disable EV_ABS_V_INVERT for the moment. (Better fix maybe needed.)
    
    evdev_btn.c:
    
        s/Ptr /Rec */g
    
        EvdevMapButton and parser.
    
        EvdevMapButtons and parser.
    
        Nuke EvdevBtnCalcRemap as a whole.
    
        Move everything but the alloc to New1 from New0.
    
        New mapping code, same guts os the axes mapping code even.

Date:   Tue Jun 5 23:12:58 2007 -0400

    Alright, this is a really big commit that breaks stuff.
    
    evdev.h:
    
        Switch to flags in the abs and rel structs.
    
        Add the axes struct, and defines.
    
        Rework the abs and rel structs, moving stuff to the axes struct and moving
        everything to the new mapping handling.
    
        Add the structs and function declarations for the new tokenization stuff,
        parsing stuff, and mapping stuff.
    
    evdev.c: Add EvdevTokenize, and the evdev_map_parsers list.
    
    evdev_axes.c:
    
        Basicly a full rewrite, big, messy.
    
        We now use a completely different mapping setup for axes, and mapping to
        buttons is currently missing.
    
        However we now handle ABS_CALIB and ABS_AREA, including rotation in both
        rel and abs modes.
    
    evdev_btn.c:
    
        Disable lots of code and break things horribly, we compile but we don't
        work very well.
    
        Fixing this is next on my todo list.

    Key: Force maximum keycode to be 255
    Even though we don't have keycodes for anything above 127, make sure our
    map always covers up to 255.  This ensures that the keycode range never
    changes.

    should help with some of the reported jitter problems.

    Move the axis to button map code back into the rel code.
    
    This might solve some problems, but should at least prevent some odd behavior.

commit dc88668839f4613d60526aa78aed3e74eebe64ad
Author: Zephaniah E. Hull <warp@agamemnon.b5>
Date:   Thu Jul 13 11:59:25 2006 -0400

    Split the New functions so that structs can be allocated and buttons
    detected, and then stuff that depends on _other_ areas.
    (Specificly, axes and btn have a circular dependency on which one has to
    run first, this solves that.)
    
    Add button names, and a way to get a button number from a name.
    
    Add a function for checking to see if a button exists, takes the number from the previous function.
    
    Change the (unused) state array of pointers in the button struct to an array of pointers to functions for callback.
    
    Implemented the 'touch' feature, on by default if BTN_DIGI_TOUCH exists,
    won't, in rel mode, process x/y data unless it's down, and is used to
    try and make 'pick up stencil, move to other side of digitizer, set back
    down' not jump to the other side of the screen in rel mode.
    (This doesn't work as well as it could, but I'm fairly sure that it's
    due to the quality of the absolute input device I'm using, but feedback
    would be really nice.)
    
    FIXME: Update the manpage for this.

    evdevAbsRec: Remove the scale bool, rename scale_x and scale_y to scale[2].
        evdevAxesRec: Make btnMap an int array instead of a Card8 array.
    Make abs support and non-core stuff actually work.
    Relative emulation for abs mode is still a bit broken, but that's far less
        critical.
    How many buttons we've registered is configuration information, not an
        error message.

    Remove evdev_abs.c and evdev_rel.c. Added evdev_axes.c.
    Change the calls to refer to EvdevAxes instead of Abs and Rel. Include
        mipointer.h. (Fixes a compile error.) Remove an unused variable from
        EvdevReadInput.
    Removed evdev_abs.c and evdev_rel.c, added evdev_axes.c. Added count to rel
        and abs. Moved btnMap from rel to the new axes. Shuffle some includes,
        and include stdarg.h.
    Removed.
    New, a mix of rel and abs that should actually work in the rel case.
    Rearrange include order. btnMap was moved from being part of rel to being
        part of axes.
    Removed.
    Rearrange include order.

    Compile with -Wall now. Add evdev.h to the sources so that make distcheck
        gets it.
    Bugzilla #5943 <https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi=5943> Make sure
        we include errno.h.
    Reduce EVDEV_MAXBUTTONS to 96.
    Split up evdevStateRec into a struct with pointers to new structs for btn,
        abs, rel, and key.
    New structure type for handling the device capability bitmaps.
    Add device bits and struct input_id to evdevDeviceRec.
    Add matching device bits, struct input_id, and pass number to
        evdevDriverRec.
    Prototype for evdevGetBits from evdev_brain.c.
    Conversion for the evdevStateRec split.
    Remove the errno.h include, it's in evdev.h for now.
    Move the bit getting from the drivers to here, into evdevDeviceRec.
    Fix a rare case of fd leakage.
    Add several new (and somewhat ugly) device matching options: <map>Bits:
        Where map is one of ev, key, rel, abs, msc, led, snd, or ff. In the
        format of '+0 +3 -1-2 ~5-10', requires bits 0 and 3 be set, bits 1 and
        2 to not be set, and at least one bit in the range of 5 to
    10 be set. bustype, vendor, product, and version: Simple integer options
        for matching the struct device_id fields, must be 0 (the default) or
        the exact value you wish to match against. pass: Bounded to 0-3,
        devices are matched to the first matching entry found, order for
        multiple matching entries in the same pass is undefined, but it starts
        with pass 0 and goes to pass 3.
    Adaptation for the evdevStateRec split and the change in capability bitmap
        handling.
    Add evdevGetBits to fill the new evdevBitsRec struct type.
    Lots of somewhat ugly code for matching by capability bits.
    Split out of evdevRescanDevices to smaller handling functions. The new
        design should be better if I decide to handle arbitrary Device fields
        again.
    Adaptation for the evdevStateRec split and the change in capability bitmap
        handling.
    Handle all buttons, no button compression at this time, however we reorder
        things so that BTN_MOUSE comes before BTN_MISC, somewhat evily.
    Support for the new btn->state[] array of int pointers.
    Adaptation for the evdevStateRec split and the change in capability bitmap
        handling.
    Adaptation for the evdevStateRec split and the change in capability bitmap

    Bug #968: Grab the event device used by the evdev driver to avoid weird
        issues when input goes to multiple places. Restrict building the evdev
        driver to 2.6 kernels since EVIOCGRAB didn't exist in 2.4.

    Add new evdev input driver. This driver uses the linux input layer directly
        and can handle both mice and keyboards.
    Convert this to UTF-8 again. The ChangeLog should be kept in UTF-8.
